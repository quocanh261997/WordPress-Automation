# WordPress-Automation
A bash script that easily setup WordPress for non-technical users 

1. If you're not using Docker, then you can instantly run the command:
```bash
./install.sh
```
or 
```
bash install.sh
```
Once the script is complete (takes about 3-5'), head over to your local browser at:
```
http://localhost:80
```
to access your wordpress site

2. If you want to run in Docker container, make sure you've already installed Docker properly, and run this command:
```
./runit
```
or 
```
bash runit
```
Afterwards, you'll enter your Docker container and can continue to execute step 1 from above to install your WordPress site.
